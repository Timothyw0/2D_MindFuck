    \maketitle
Our project 2D MindFuck is based upon the programming language BrainFuck with extensions of the memory
cell representation. In the original BrainFuck language, memory cells are represented linearly whereas 
the user can move the pointer to the left and right to edit the value of the memory cell. This allows 
for a Turing-Complete language that can perform basic arithmetic as well as taking in input and printing
output. For this project, we decided to extend this even further by changing the memory cell representation
into 2 dimensions. This allows for users to traverse the memory cells from left and right as well as up and
down within each memory cell. In order to create this language, we will be using flex and yacc for the 
language scanning and parsing and LLVM will provide the back-end compiling for our language. To go more in depth,
LLVM will be used to manage the memory stored within the memory cells based upon what the user inputs into the 
MindFuck file.
